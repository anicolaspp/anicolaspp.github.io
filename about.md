### More Information

I am a software engineer at IPC, an independent SUBWAYÂ® franchisee-owned and operated purchasing cooperative, where I work on their Big Data Platform. Very interested in Apache Spark, Hadoop, distributed systems, algorithms, and functional programming, especially in the C# and the Scala programming languages.

In the past, I have done a lot of programming and engineering in C# on the .NET Framework, an environment where I feel very comfortable and knowledgeable. 

Past work includes payment processing systems, POS systems, and mobile systems. All of them have allowed me to grow professionally in different areas of expertise.
